# LOAN_ELIGIBILTY
This Machine Learning Project check on the eligibility of the Loan Applicant by understanding the details of the Applicant and decide on whether to provide loan of the respective amount or not.

The model takes various numerical and categorical variables like loan amount, applicant income, credit history etc to narrow down its search to find the best outcome.

The project extensively works on Exploratory Data Analysis to find the relationship between various variables and also find the distribution.

Various Data Preprocessing Techinques like Handling Missing values, Handling Outliers, Scaling Etc to clean the data for the algorithm to work properly and derive accurate results.

Finally the algorithm is selected after trying various algorithms including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, KNN, Decision Tree and Random Forest. This model is optimised using hyperparameter tuning techniques to reach final result.
